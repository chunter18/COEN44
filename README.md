# COEN44
These projects are my lab work for my Computer Engineering 44 - Introduction to C class, Santa Clara University, Fall 2016. The code is pretty basic, but illustrates understanding of core concepts of C.

In each lab folder you will find the lab, with a short desciption of its functionality at the top, and the actual assignment pdf the lab is based on.
